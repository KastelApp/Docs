Gateway events are messages transmitted through a Gateway connection. They can flow from a client to Kastel or from Kastel to a client. Clients mainly send events relating to their connection, heartbeating, reconnecting etc etc, whilst they receive events relating to actions, like a new message being created, or it being deleted etc etc.

You can find an example payload [here](#gateway-event-payload).

## Examples

### Gateway Event Payload

```json
{
    "op": 0, // The opcode of the event
    "d": {}, // The data of the event
    "s": 0, // The sequence number of the event
    "e": "MessageCreate" // The event name (not always present)
}
```

### Hello

Hello Event is sent by Kastel to the client to notify the client that the connection has been established.

It'll look something like this

```json
{
    "op": 0,
    "d": {
        "Date": 1683904844454
    },
    "s": 1
}
```

It provides the client with the time that the connection was established, which can be used however the client wants.

### Auth

The Auth Event is sent by the client to Kastel to authenticate the client.

```json
{
    "op": 1,
    "d": {
    "Settings": {
        "Compress": false
    },
    "Token": "b0413abad803eacb2c8198df0b5315c46915c13985b1fcf57b1bbcba5cd6842b"
    }
}
```

### Authed

The Authed Event is sent by Kastel to the client to confirm that the client has been authenticated. As well as some crucial information about the client.

```json

    "op": 2,
