Gateway events are messages transmitted through a Gateway connection. They can flow from a client to Kastel or from Kastel to a client. Clients mainly send events relating to their connection, heartbeating, reconnecting etc etc, whilst they receive events relating to actions, like a new message being created, or it being deleted etc etc.

You can find an example payload [here](#gateway-event-payload).


## Examples

### Gateway Event Payload

```json
{
    "op": 0, // The opcode of the event
    "d": {}, // The data of the event
    "s": 0, // The sequence number of the event
    "e": "MessageCreate" // The event name (not always present)
}
```
