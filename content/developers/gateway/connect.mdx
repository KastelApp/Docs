Once you connect to the gateway you get a [`Hello`](/developers/gateway-events#hello), You are expected to respond with a [`Auth`](/developers/gateway-events#auth) in around ~5 seconds. If you do not respond in time you will be disconnected.

## Gateway URL

The gateway URL is `wss://gateway.kastelapp.com/{endpoint}?v={version}&encoding={encoding}`
