Connecting to the Gateway is pretty simple, in this example I'm using the [ws](https://npmjs.com/package/ws) package.

```js
const WebSocket = require("ws");

const version = 1;
const encoding = "json";

const payloads = {
  Hello: 0,
  Auth: 1,
  Authed: 2,
  HeartBeat: 3,
  HeartBeatAck: 4,
};

const ws = new WebSocket(
  `wss://gateway.kastelapp.com/client?v=${version}&encoding=${encoding}`
);

ws.on("open", () => {
  console.log("Connected to the gateway!");
});

let heartbeatInterval;
const Token = "The token here"
let sessionId;
let sequence = 0;
let lastHeartbeat = -1;

ws.on("message", (data) => {
  try {
    data = JSON.parse(data);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Invalid JSON received from the gateway!");
    return;
  }

    if (data?.s) sequence = data.s;

  switch (data.op) {
    case payloads.Hello:

        console.log("Received Hello payload from the gateway, trying to authenticate...");

        ws.send(
          JSON.stringify({
            op: payloads.Auth,
            d: {
              Token: Token,
              Settings: {
                Compress: false, // This if true receives zlib compressed data 
              }
            },
          })
        );
      break;
    case payloads.Authed:
        console.log("Received Authed payload from the gateway, authenticated!");

        heartbeatInterval = setInterval(() => {
          ws.send(
            JSON.stringify({
              op: payloads.HeartBeat,
              d: {
                Sequence: sequence,
              },
            })
          );
        }, data.d.HeartbeatInterval);

        break;
    case payloads.HeartBeatAck:
        console.log("Received HeartBeatAck payload from the gateway, heartbeat acknowledged!");

        lastHeartbeat = Date.now();

        break;
    default:
        console.log(`Received unknown payload from the gateway! (${data.op})`);
        break;
  }
});
```

That example connects to the gateway, authenticates and sends a heartbeat with the provided interval.
