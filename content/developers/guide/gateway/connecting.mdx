Connecting to the Gateway is pretty simple, in this example I'm using the [ws](https://npmjs.com/package/ws) package.

```js
const WebSocket = require("ws");

const version = 1
const encoding = "json"

const payloads = {
    0:
}

const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://gateway.kastelapp.com/client?v=${version}&encoding=${encoding}`);

ws.on("open", () => {
    console.log("Connected to the gateway!");
});

```
